Clone fastai using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai.git
```
Then clone fastai_ws using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alessaww/fastai_ws.git
```

Then, `cd` to the fastai_ws folder and create a link to the fastai library:

```sh
ln -s ../fastai/fastai/ fastai
```

create another link to the dataset:

```sh
ln -s ../home/ubuntu/data/ data
```
