# fastai_ws

My work after following fast.ai course. The fast.ai deep learning library, lessons, and tutorials. [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai)

Clone fastai using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai.git
```
Then clone fastai_ws using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alessaww/fastai_ws.git
```

Then, `cd` to the fastai_ws folder and create a link to the fastai library:

```sh
ln -s ../fastai/fastai/ fastai
```

create another link to the dataset:

```sh
ln -s ../home/ubuntu/data/ data
```

There are some files generated by this model.

1. test_trained_for_3m.mid - this is a generated file after we trained the model for 1 epoch - `learner.fit(3e-3, 1, wds=1e-6)`
1. test_trained_for_23m.mid - this after another 7 epochs - `learner.fit(3e-3, 3, wds=1e-6, cycle_len=1, cycle_mult=2)`
1. test_trained_for_3h.mid - and this is after 50 epochs - `learner.fit(3e-3, 10, wds=1e-6, cycle_len=5, cycle_save_name='adam3_10')`
1. test_trained_for_3h_Queen.mid - this result is done with the full trained model, with input a sequence from A Kind Of Magic - Queen
